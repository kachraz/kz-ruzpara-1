## Response

**Booty Dance** is a style of dance that emphasizes movements centered around the hips, buttocks, and lower body, often blending elements from hip-hop, reggaeton, Afrobeats, and dancehall. It’s popular in genres like **Afrobeats, dancehall, and Latin music**, where artists like **Davido, Wizkid, Daddy Yankee, and Shakira** have made it a key part of their performances.

**Booty Candy Technology** is a more playful, slang term referring to the exaggerated, rhythmic "booty-popping" movements in music videos or live performances. The term suggests that the dance moves make the woman's body (specifically the buttocks) appear as if they're moving independently or propelling the dance—almost like a robotic or "technological" effect. It’s often used humorously in **Afrobeats and reggaeton** contexts.

Would you like examples of songs or artists known for this style?
